# SportHub  

This project has 2 folders. One to server and another to the client.  Therefore, to run you will need two terminals to run both projects at same time.
  

## Client setup

* open the terminal

* type

```

cd client

```

* use the command

```
npm install

npm run serve

```

The prompt will display the access URL.

## Server setup

* open the terminal

* type

```

cd server

```

* use the command

```
npm install

nodemon node server.js

```

The prompt will display the access URL.
